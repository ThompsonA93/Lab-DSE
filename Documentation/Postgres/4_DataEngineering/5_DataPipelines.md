## Pipeline Architecture: Extract, Load, Transform

### Extraction
* Connecting to Sources
* Incremental Loading

### Transformation
* Data Modification
* Schema Evolution

### Loading
* Upload Target Definition
* Upserts (Updates/Inserts)


### Pipeline Architecture

- ELT
- ETL
- ETLTL


## Orchestration and Scheduling

### Workflow Management
* Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): A set of tasks with dependencies that must run in a defined, non-circular sequence.
* Scheduling

### Fault Tolerance and Idempotency
* Fault Tolerance
* Idempotency

### Monitoring and Error Handling
* Alerting
* Data Quality

### Orchestration Tools
- Apache Airflow
- Dagster
