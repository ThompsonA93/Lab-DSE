- Associative Entity

### Types of Attributes

- Attributes
- Key Attributes
- Partial Key Attributes
- Multivalued Attributes
- Derived Attribtues


### Types of Relationships 

- Strong Relationship
- Weak Relationship
- Optional Relationship

### Cardinality

- One-to-one
- One-to-many
- Many-to-one
- Many-to-many

### Participation

- Total participation
- Partial participation





## Unified Modelling Language

### Creating the UML-Diagram

### Types of Classes

### Types of Relationships

- Association
- Aggregation
- Composition
- Inheritance



## Modelling Strategies

### Top-Down

1. Design all Entities
2. Add Relationships
3. Add Attributes

### Bottom-Up

1. Design one entity with attributes
2. Add relating entity with attributes
3. Repeat (2.) until finished


## Modelling Qualities

### Schema Quality

- Correctness
- Consistency
- Completeness
- Conciseness
- Comprehensibility
